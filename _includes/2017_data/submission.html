                        Papers will be limited to up to <b>8 pages (including text, figures and tables) and up to 2 pages of reference</b> and enabled for double-blind reviewing. All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 2 members of the program committee. The selection of the papers will be based on the significance of results, technical merit(s), relevance, and clarity of presentation. The final program will consist of previously unpublished and contributed papers with substantial time allocated to discussion. In case of acceptance, at least one author has to register and present the paper at CMMCA2023.

                        Besides, CMMCA2023 is in cooperation with <b>Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics (GMIG) for a special issue</b>. Some of the best papers announced in the workshop will be invited for their extensions of works to publication in the special issue, and all papers will go through a peer view process. Please notice our news update for the submission.
